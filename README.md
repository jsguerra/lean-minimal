# Lean Minimal Concept

> Conceptual site, elements still being developed

This is a design concept using a very minimal design with lean coding. The goal is to create styles and javascript with as few lines as possible while maintaining the desired design and responsiveness.

## Branches
There is currently a master branch with an HTML5 site and a dev branch with a WordPress version.
