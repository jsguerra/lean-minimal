# Lean Minimal Concept

> Conceptual site, elements still being developed

This is a design concept using a very minimal design with lean coding. The goal is to create styles and javascript with as few lines as possible while maintaining the desired design and responsiveness.

No task runners have been setup on this project. Initially used Sass --watch from terminal to watch and compile css.
